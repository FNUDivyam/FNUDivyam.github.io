1. Before cloud computing= if we see toward the history so before cloud computing we had (SOA)   Which used to provide the the     business functionality and had an option to share the data from one system to another . Moreover, before cloud computing in the technology world had a biggest challenge for security, privacy of our personal data.


2. Why Cloud = now we got the cloud in this era so this helps users to get their application  to market quickly . Apart from that , if we look toward the data security so cloud computing gives us the way for data backup and data recovery and it has a capability to make business continuity easier and less expensive . further more for keeping a lot of data then also the cloud helps .

 3. What is cloud = cloud computing is something which does alot of thing by itself especially data storage and computing power and the cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device moreover, it storing applications on remote servers , processing data from servers and accessing applications via internet.


4. Service models = the cloud computing service models are laas , paas , saas. 

    Saas = (Software as a service) is a way of delivering applications over the internet as a service. instead of installing and maintaining software , you simply access it via the internet , freeing yourself from complex soft5ware and hardware management.

    paas = (platform as a service), as the name paas provides computing platform which typically includes operating system , part from that resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud based apps to sophisticated and cloud enabled enterprise application. and example can be windows azure. 

    lass =  (infrastructure as a service) lass is logging as a service and it is an IT model for collecting any type of log filesv such as servers and it is something which reduces the physical machine users.

5. USERS OF SERVICE MODELS = Lass
    
    So if i talk about the lass so in this Data,Applications,Runtime ,Middleware , O/S are managed by us but like virtualization
    Servers,Storage and Networking type of things ar4e operated ny vendors 

  Pass= in this in our hand has only two things to manage which are Data and Application and the vendors access is higher than our operating system like the Runtime,Middleware,o/s,virtualization,o/s,servers storage and networking are managed by vendors 

  Saas= in saas we can just only manage Data but the saas is only one model in which vendors accessibility is preety high so except data everything comes under the vendors like Application Runtime , Middleware, o/s , virtualization, servers, storage and networking as well. 


6. Deployment models =  so lets talk about first what is deploymentcloud deployment model is defined according to where the infrastructure for the deployment resides and who has control over that infrastruce and Deployment models are like private cloud , public cloud , hybrid cloud 


Ist deployment model is public cloud which is a service provider and make resources such as applications and storage , available to the general public over the internet apart from that , it is easy and inexpensive set up because hardware , applications and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.

2nd is Private cloud and this is the cloud which has a higher level of security and privacy of data through firewalland internal hosting and this is that model of cloud computing as well whwre the infrastructure is dedicated to a single user organozation and example we can say here hp data centers.

3rd is hybrid cloud which is an IT architecture that incorporates some degree of workload portability , management and many more environments and this enables to a business to deploy its most sensitive workload in an on premises cloud and host to less critical resources on a third party public cloud provider and the example can be see like google cloud. 

7. Cloud Providers = like in this video has taken a lot of examples like what kind of cloud computers we have now in this world but the best thing i noticed which is an amazon web service storage power , apart from that if any other cloud platform has just x storage so amazon has 6x storage which is an incredible thing and if we take the example of netflix so amazon web service provides the space to the netflix for hosting their websites.

8. AWS = provides free tier and they have great services as well and this is the platform where we dont need to provide any affrent money and this is the AWS which provides us the free 12 month free trial iin which has some rule and regulation which we have to follow and if we are following those rules then we can easily access it .
 
  Details = amazon Ec2 in this option this platform provides you 750 hours free trial which is most popular plan in this And the other option is amazon quicksight which has 1 GB and it is something which is fast easy to use and a lot of platform like amazon , RDS , S3, LAMBDA and aws lambda does not allow you to post website bit it can keep files and this was very informative video for cloud and i got to know about a lot about cloud and AWS as wll and at the end of the videi o got to know how to create an account on google cloud.
